                   <p  style="color:  #696969">
                    The ACM is an umbrella organization for academic and scholarly interests in computer science. Its motto is “Advancing Computing as a Science & Profession”. Founded in 1947 it is the world’s largest scientific and educational computing society.<br>

The LNMIIT ACM Student Chapter was officially chartered by ACM Chapters Program Coordinator on November 13, 2017. Currently, our chapter has more than 200+ chapter members. Since then ACM LNMIIT Student Chapter is working extremely hard to carry forward the legacy ACM has established over the years. Our chapter was started with a prime focus on implementing a firm professional culture among the students apart from the regular academics. Our team has a comprehensive understanding of ACM and its events and we put in a lot of discussions to cherry-pick our events. We have a talented and diligent team working to deliver the best of ACM to the institute. With a striking balance among the team members, we have highly-skilled technical leads, dedicated designers and management personnel along with a sincere general body.
